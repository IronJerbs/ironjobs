# Iron Jobs

An application for sharing job postings with other Iron Yard students and graduates.

## How to run

Easy! First, clone the repo locally. Then install the dependencies with `npm install`.
Last thing: run it on the command line with `npm start`

## About the project

This application stores the data using a document database (MongoDB) along with an ODM (Mongoose). The back end API is built using Node and Express.

## How to develop

### Client

The client is provided, but if you want to tweak it, just edit the files
in the `client/` directory. Note that you will need to run `sass` on the styles
in order to build the `style.css` file!
